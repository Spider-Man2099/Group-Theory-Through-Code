# Group-Theory-Through-Code

This program was created as a project for my Abstract Algebra course. The goal is to automate some of the calculations usually done when determining whether a set of 
integers is a group or subgroup, as well as some of the accompanying characteristics of these mathematical structures. 

The program can be run here: https://replit.com/@Spider-Man2014/A-Look-at-Groups-Through-Code?v=1 

# Technologies 

- C++ 14

# Features 

 - Allows users to create a group of integers mod *n*
 - Allows users to create a subgroup of units U_n 
 - Allows the user to create a finite cyclic subgroup from elgibile elements
 - Calculates the order of each of the sets described above
